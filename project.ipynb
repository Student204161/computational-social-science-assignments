    "The central idea behind the project is to research communities on a subset of StackOverFlow Q&A using a network describing interactions between users. It is interesting to answer questions like- What is the modularity of the Network, How discernable are the communities from each other in terms of topics discussed & How do they differ? A hypothesis could be that each community uses primarily their own programming language. We could also google the top 5 authors by score or amount of activity to see their specialization - It can also be interesting to look at score, does the highest scoring post depend on community size and to what degree if? Are some communities better at resolving questions? Look at proportion of closed to non-closed questions.\n",

As to the benefits of OOP... I don\\'t know. I don\\'t think it\\'s worse than procedural stuff. \\nOn the lighter side, my OOP lecturer said that OOP is important because otherwise the \"code would have too many loops\". Yeah. Sometimes it\\'s depressing that I pay $500 per paper. :(\\n', '48055': \"I sure as hell can't. Small errors explode into pages and pages of unreadable junk. Usually early in the morning, before coffee. :(\\nMy only advice is to take a deep breath, start at the top and try and parse the important pieces of information. (I know, easier said than done, right?).  \\n\", '51394': \"I wonder how widespread the JVM actually is? In the case of Flash, IE5 preinstalled it, giving it a large automatic user base. But unless the JVM was included with the OS install, users wouldn't have it. I suppose as a developer you target the largest install base, meaning choosing Flash over Java.\\nThere are Java applets here and there; definitely not widespread though.\\n\", '142425': \"I just have a number. First release is 001. Second release's third beta is 002b3, and so on. This is just for personal stuff mind, I don't actually have anything 'released' at the moment, so this is all theory.\\n\", '526668': 'You need a main function:\\n// The arguments are only needed if passing arguments to your program.\\n// You could just use `int main()`.\\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\\n{\\n    Race race;\\n    race.executeRace();\\n}\\n\\nor so, without seeing your specific error. \\n', '1782256': 'The answer, it seems, is to use GDC, if you can stand going back to D 2.015 (this is for D2, I have no idea how old the D1 stuff is). GDB works great.\\n', '2520280': \"Yes, the function must be declared as extern (C).\\nThe calling convention of functions in C and D are different, so you must tell the compiler to use the C convention with extern (C). I don't know why you don't have to do this in C++.\\nSee here for more information on interfacing with C.\\nIt's also worth noting that you can use the C style for declaring function arguments.\\n\", '6242610': \"If you merely want a pointer, the correct way is to use the 'ptr' property (available for all dynamic arrays, not just strings)\\nstr.ptr\\n\\nHowever, if you are wanting something to use with C, to ensure it is nul-terminated, use toStringz\\nimport std.string;\\ntoStringz(str);\\n\\ntoStringz will not perform a copy if the string is already nul terminated. \\n\", '6556872': \"I asked around on IRC, and as far as we can figure out it was never implemented for D1, so we're guessing it's still unimplemented. Furthermore, there is no mention of the feature in The D Programming Language, so the whole thing is up in the air a bit.\\nIf I were you, I would submit a bug against the documentation. \\n\"}}\n"
